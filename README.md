# 🕵️ Spot the Bot: Detecting AI-Generated Text in the Wild

## 🔍 Project Overview  
The recent surge in LLM-generated content raises new challenges in authorship attribution. This project aims to detect whether a given text was written by a human or generated by a large language model (GPT, Bard).  

We explored a full pipeline:  
- Interpretable baselines using punctuation and TF-IDF  
- Perplexity-based scoring with `distilgpt2`  
- A pre-trained RoBERTa detector  
- A meta-classifier combining all scores  

Final performance (F1 > 97%) shows strong potential in combining weak signals into a robust detector. We also focused on interpretability (SHAP, confusion matrices) to avoid black-box models.

We additionally evaluated the robustness of the detector using ChatGPT-4o, showing that it is capable of generating adversarial human-like poetries.
